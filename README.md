AUTOMATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH IAC USING TERRAFORM PART 2

- Before we go deeper into automating other parts of our infrastructure on AWS, it is very important to fully understand certain concepts around **Networking** (in case this is completely new area to you). Networking is a very broad topic and some of internals of Terraform modules related to Networking, like ***cidrsubnet()***, may still not be fully clear to you.

- To fully clear your understanding, we highly recommend you watching Networking videos by Eli the Computer Guy on YouTube, and in addition to that, read following golden articles on **Networking Terminology, Interfaces, Protocols, IP Address, Subnets, and CIDR Notation by Justin Ellingwood from Digital Ocean**.
